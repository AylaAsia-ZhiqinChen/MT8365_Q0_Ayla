            On 2018-12-12, GetAddrInfoStressTest_Binder_100 suddenly jumped
            from ~1xs to ~70s runtime in APCT continuous integration, causing
            resolv_integration_test to flake with the default 60s timeout.
            We're not sure what caused the regression, but it's not due to a change
            in the Android image and unlikely to affect users.
            Just bump the timeout to 120s for now.
