WHAT IT DOES?
=============
These are test programs for protect-shared memory tests including:

(1) pmem_share_s
    Basic tests of protect-shared memory read/write between GZ and TEE.
    It will go through libion, kernel ION/TMEM/SSMR, GZ and TEE.
    And TEE will map memory with NS=0.

(2) pmem_share_ns
    Basic tests of protect-shared memory read/write between GZ and TEE.
    It will go through libion, kernel ION/TMEM/SSMR, GZ and TEE.
    And TEE will map memory with NS=1 and remaped PA.

(3) pmem_ion_fast
    Basic tests of protect-shared memory module using ION for IT purpose.
    It will go through libion, kernel ION/TMEM/SSMR, GZ and TEE.
    And for saturation test, it will test for chunk size more that 1MB.

(4) pmem_ion
    Basic tests of protect-shared memory module using ION for IT purpose.
    It will go through libion, kernel ION/TMEM/SSMR, GZ and TEE.

(5) pmem_perf
    Do tests for ion allocation for profiling purpuse.
    It will go through libion, kernel ION/TMEM/SSMR, GZ and TEE.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
=================
It could be built with mmm or mm build command.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Use adb push command to install test programs to device directly,
and then execute them using adb commands.
