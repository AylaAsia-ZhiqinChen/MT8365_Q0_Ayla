The static library 'libtz_app_modular_drm' is the library provide basic widevine modular drm  functions in MTK in-house TEE.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

The libtz_app_modular_drm is the basic library provide the basic dec-enc mac algorithoms for widevine modular drm, so to protect the key and the clear content.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

if you want to build this modular only, just use "mm", also source code is in this directory.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Linked with trustzone image, and call the basic functions provided by it.


Most of  the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co.., but it also used the open source algorithom lib---- libtom.
