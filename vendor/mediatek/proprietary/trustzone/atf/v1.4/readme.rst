ARM Trusted Firmware - version 1.4
==================================

ARM Trusted Firmware provides a reference implementation of secure world
software for `ARMv8-A`_, including a `Secure Monitor`_ executing at
Exception Level 3 (EL3). It implements various ARM interface standards, such as:

-  The `Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)`_
-  Trusted Board Boot Requirements (TBBR, ARM DEN0006C-1)
-  `SMC Calling Convention`_
-  `System Control and Management Interface`_

As far as possible the code is designed for reuse or porting to other ARMv8-A
model and hardware platforms.

ARM will continue development in collaboration with interested parties to
provide a full reference implementation of Secure Monitor code and ARM standards
to the benefit of all developers working with ARMv8-A TrustZone technology.

This Release
------------

This release provides a suitable starting point for productization of secure
world boot and runtime firmware, in either the AArch32 or AArch64 execution
state.

Users are encouraged to do their own security validation, including penetration
testing, on any secure world code derived from ARM Trusted Firmware.

Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Initialization of the secure world, for example exception vectors, control
   registers and interrupts for the platform.

-  Library support for CPU specific reset and power down sequences. This
   includes support for errata workarounds and the latest ARM DynamIQ CPUs.

-  Drivers to enable standard initialization of ARM System IP, for example
   Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC), Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI),
   Cache Coherent Network (CCN), Network Interconnect (NIC) and TrustZone
   Controller (TZC).

-  A generic `SCMI`_ driver to interface with conforming power controllers, for
   example the ARM System Control Processor (SCP).

-  SMC (Secure Monitor Call) handling, conforming to the `SMC Calling
   Convention`_ using an EL3 runtime services framework.

-  `PSCI`_ library support for CPU, cluster and system power management
   use-cases.
   This library is pre-integrated with the AArch64 EL3 Runtime Software, and
   is also suitable for integration with other AArch32 EL3 Runtime Software,
   for example an AArch32 Secure OS.

-  A minimal AArch32 Secure Payload (SP\_MIN) to demonstrate `PSCI`_ library
   integration with AArch32 EL3 Runtime Software.

-  Secure Monitor library code such as world switching, EL1 context management
   and interrupt routing.
   When a Secure-EL1 Payload (SP) is present, for example a Secure OS, the
   AArch64 EL3 Runtime Software must be integrated with a dispatcher component
   (SPD) to customize the interaction with the SP.

-  A Test SP/SPD to demonstrate AArch64 Secure Monitor functionality and SP
   interaction with PSCI.

-  SPDs for the `OP-TEE Secure OS`_, `NVidia Trusted Little Kernel`_
   and `Trusty Secure OS`_.

-  A Trusted Board Boot implementation, conforming to all mandatory TBBR
   requirements. This includes image authentication, Firmware Update (or
   recovery mode), and packaging of the various firmware images into a
   Firmware Image Package (FIP).

-  Pre-integration of TBB with the ARM TrustZone CryptoCell product, to take
   advantage of its hardware Root of Trust and crypto acceleration services.

-  Support for alternative boot flows, for example to support platforms where
   the EL3 Runtime Software is loaded using other firmware or a separate
   secure system processor.

-  Support for the GCC, LLVM and ARM Compiler 6 toolchains.

see the `Firmware Design`_ and supporting documentation. The `Change Log`_
provides details of changes made since the last release.
