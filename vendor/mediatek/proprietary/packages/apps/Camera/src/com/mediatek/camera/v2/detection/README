WHAT IS Detection?
==================
1.An accessory function which must be attached to module.
2.Detection features must relay on camera device.
3.Unlike stream features, detection features will not process buffers.

HOW TO USE IT?
==================
All the detection use MVP architecture and manager by DetectionManager.
The main function of the DetectionManager includes:listens detection settings
change,notify the detection to update,aubmit capture request and dispatch
capture result to the detections.
The MTK way of adding a new detection:
1.New a detection view and presenter implement in DetectionManager.The view
instance is a parameter of the presenter.
2.The detection device implement is create in presenter implement constructor,
that is to say,the presenter implement includes the detection view and detection
device implement.
The detection device implement has a capture observer and DetectionManager help
to register the observer and notify detection device implement the capture result.
3.The presenter set a listener to the device implement,once capture callback
has received,device implement will notify presenter and presenter will trigger
view update.

The third party could use their own way to manager the detections.
