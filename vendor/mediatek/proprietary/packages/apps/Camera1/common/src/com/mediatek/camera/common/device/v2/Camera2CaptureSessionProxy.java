     * <p>

     * {@link CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession}, Once created, the session is
     * active until a new session is created by the camera device, or the camera device is closed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An active high speed capture session is a specialized capture session that is only
     * targeted at
     * high speed video recording (>=120fps) use case if the camera device supports high speed video
     * capability (i.e., {@link CameraCharacteristics#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES} contains
     * {@link CameraMetadata#REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_CONSTRAINED_HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO}). It only
     * accepts request lists created via {@link #createHighSpeedRequestList}, and the request
     * list can
     * only be submitted to this session via
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession#captureBurst captureBurst}, or
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession#setRepeatingBurst setRepeatingBurst}. See
     * {@link CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession} for more details of the
     * limitations.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Creating a session is an expensive operation and can take several hundred milliseconds,
     * since it
     * requires configuring the camera device's internal pipelines and allocating memory buffers for
     * sending images to the desired targets. Therefore the setup is done asynchronously, and
     * {@link CameraDevice#createConstrainedHighSpeedCaptureSession} will send the ready-to-use
     * CameraCaptureSession to the provided listener's
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigured} callback. If configuration cannot be
     * completed, then the {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed} is
     * called, and
     * the session will not become active.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Any capture requests (repeating or non-repeating) submitted before the session is ready
     * will be
     * queued up and will begin capture once the session becomes ready. In case the session
     * cannot be
     * configured and
     * {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onConfigureFailed onConfigureFailed} is
     * called, all queued capture requests are discarded.  </p>
     * -->
     * <p>
     * If a new session is created by the camera device, then the previous session is closed, and
     * its
     * associated {@link CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback#onClosed onClosed} callback will be
     * invoked. All of the session methods will throw an IllegalStateException if called once the
     * session is closed.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A closed session clears any repeating requests (as if {@link #stopRepeating} had been
