CmasEM.apk provides SIM-ME Lock settings in engineer mode.

This apk is pre-built by MediaTek internal.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
MtkTelephonyAssist.apk is used for customer project only, and will only release to customer with
TELEPHONYASSIST license.
It is used to decouple customer and MTK Telephony framework. Since MTK RILD need to sync screen
state and mobile data settings state to RILD, and some customer's telephony will not offer such API,
we need to move these feature to a vendor apk which runs in phone process.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1. telephony-common

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
system/

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

This apk runs in com.android.phone process and will lunch a service
after device bootup automatically.
