The RCS-e stack is an open source implementation of the Rich Communication Suite standards for Google Android platform. 
This implementation is compliant to GSMA RCS-e Blackbird standards. 
Thanks to its client/server API, the stack may be easily integrated with existing native Android applications (e.g. address book, dialer) and 
permits to create new RCS applications (e.g. chat, widgets).
This application  is enhanced by MediaTek internally.
