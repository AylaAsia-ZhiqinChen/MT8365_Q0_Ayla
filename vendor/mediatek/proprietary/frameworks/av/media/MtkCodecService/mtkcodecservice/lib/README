Library of MTK ape decode features, including Bn codec service.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
vendor.mediatek.hardware.mtkcodecservice@1.1-impl.so contains MediaTek developed ape decoder related  modules.  
Without it, ape will not decode.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  libutils
2.  libcutils
3.  libhidlbase
4.  libhidltransport
5.  libhwbinder
6.  liblog          
7.  libdl.so                   
8.  libui.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libapedec_mtk.so
All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in current folder

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Will be linked with the vendor.mediatek.hardware.mtkcodeservice@1.1-service executable and any other modules need to
control mtkcodecservice.
