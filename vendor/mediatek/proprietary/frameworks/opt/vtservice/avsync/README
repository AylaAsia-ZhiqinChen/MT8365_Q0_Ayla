This module creates the VT (Video Telephony) libraries.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
VT is a native service which serves the video telephony functionality.
The service work on both 3G/4G network.
For 3G network, the serivce implement 3g324m stack and pass the media package to Modem.
For 4G network, the service communicate between Phone APK, Multimedia, IMS module.

libmtk_vt_swip.so contain the 3g324m stack.
libmtk_vt_utils.so contain the utility API for VT module usage.
libmtk_vt_service.so contain the main interface for Phone APK & the module to handle the communication interface between IMS & Multimedia.
libvt_avsync.so contain interface for AV sync functionality when receiving data.
vtservice bin file is the entry of the video telephony service.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:

libutils, libcutils, libstagefright, libandroid_runtime, libbinder,
libnativehelper, libui, libgui, libmedia, libstagefright_foundation,
libcamera_client, libskia and libblisrc
        											    											    
libEGL, libGLESv2, libandroid, libcutils, liblog, libstlport and libutils

and the following libs from MediaTek:

libimsma.so 
libsource.so
libimsma_rtp.so

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

The VT libraries should not be used directly by an application developer.  
The AOSP video call provider framework provides a more suitable API.
(frameworks\base\telecomm\java\android\telecom).

The majority of source code for this library were written by MediaTek.  
Various open source libraries are also used and contained in this folder.
