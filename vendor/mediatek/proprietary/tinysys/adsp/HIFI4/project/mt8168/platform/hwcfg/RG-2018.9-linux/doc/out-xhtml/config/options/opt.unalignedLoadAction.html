        <p class="p">Traditional RISC processors expect that variables are aligned to their natural
            boundaries. For example, a 32-bit int variable is expected to be aligned to 32-bits. The
            C and C++ compilers will always align variables appropriately. However, through the use
            of casts, parameters or pointers might point to unaligned data. The compiler will assume
            that all data is properly aligned unless itâ€™s obvious to the compiler that it is not.
            For example, ((int *) 0x1), is obviously unaligned.</p>

        <p class="p"><span class="ph">Cadence</span> offers three configuration options to deal with
            circumstances where unaligned accesses occur. With Align address, the hardware will zero
            the bottom bits of the address before performing the memory access. This is rarely the
            desired behavior and is mainly provided for compatibility with earlier <span class="ph">Cadence</span> processors that only offered this option. This option
            is also unsupported on configurations with a data memory interface of greater than
            128-bits. With Take exception, the hardware will throw an exception whenever an
            unaligned access is attempted. Typically, unaligned accesses should be treated as
            programming errors and the exception is an aid to debugging. However, for those running
            Linux on Xtensa processors, the exception handler in Linux will emulate an unaligned
            hardware access using multiple-aligned accesses. Using the exception handler is slow,
            but is useful when running open source drivers that are not performance critical and
            assume support for unaligned accesses. Note that writing handlers that emulate unaligned
            accesses is not easy or supported for configurations with FLIX. The third option,
            Handled by hardware, has the hardware automatically support unaligned accesses. Note
            that the hardware for handling these accesses takes several cycles so that
            performance-critical code should still only issue aligned accesses. The advantage of
            having the hardware handle the unaligned accesses is that it is faster than the
            emulation routine available in the exception handler and is also able to work together
            with FLIX. The advantage of the exception is that it makes it easier to identify and fix
            unaligned accesses, leading to more efficient and reliable code. Diamond processors
            provided by <span class="ph">Cadence</span> use the Take exception option. </p>
