        <p class="p">The MAC16 instruction family is a series of instructions allowing a 16-bit multiply
            accumulate into a 40-bit accumulator in parallel with two 16-bit updating loads. It
            allows a full iteration of a 16-bit dot product every cycle. Note that the instructions
            in this family that perform loads in parallel with the multiply accumulate are
            specialized and are not inferred by the C compiler. The only way to use these
            instructions is with compiler intrinsics or with hand-coded assembly. Note that using
            intrinsics, the specialized m registers are accessed by passing in their index, 0 to 3,
            directly into the intrinsic. The compiler is able to infer use of the multiply
            accumulate instruction that does not execute in parallel with a load. However, this
            instruction is typically no faster than what is enabled by the MUL16 option.</p>

        <p class="p">With no other multiplication options, the compiler will emulate 32-bit multiplications
            using the MAC16 instructions.</p>
