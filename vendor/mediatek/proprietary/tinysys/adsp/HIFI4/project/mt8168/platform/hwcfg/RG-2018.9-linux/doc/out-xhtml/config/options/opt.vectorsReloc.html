        <p class="p">By default, vector addresses are fixed at processor configuration time and cannot be
            changed.</p>

        <p class="p">This option adds the following capabilities: </p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Static Vectors Group</strong>: the 2 vectors in this group are the reset vector
                    and, if configured, the memory error vector. As before, when a processor
                    configuration is created, addresses are determined for all vectors based on the
                    memory layout. If the relocatable vectors option is selected, an alternate
                    address is also specified at configuration time. The auto-placement algorithm
                    (if enabled) will try and choose an appropriate instruction memory. When the XPG
                    builds the processor, both primary and alternate addresses will be in the
                    generated output. By default, at reset, the processor will jump to the "primary"
                    configured reset address. Alternatively a pin on the processor can be asserted
                    to cause it to jump to the alternate reset address.</p>

                <p class="p">When software is generated for the processor, you have the option of placing the
                    reset handler code at the primary address or at the alternate address. If you
                    plan to make use of this feature, you should build both software configurations
                    so you can link binaries with the corresponding handler code.</p>

                <p class="p">The hardware implementation of the relocatable vectors option places constraints
                    on the ordering of vectors in memory (if memory errors are configured, the
                    vector must be after the reset vector), and the vectors must be contained within
                    a 4K block of memory.</p>

            </li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Dynamic Vectors Group</strong>: the other exception vectors are collectively referred
                to as the dynamic group because their location in memory can be changed at runtime.
                These vectors must all be in the order shown above (if configured), and must be
                contained within a 4K block of memory.</li>

        </ul>

        <div class="p">Consult the <span class="ph"><em class="ph i">Xtensa System Software Reference Manual</em></span> and <span class="ph"><em class="ph i">Xtensa Linker Support Packages (LSPs) Reference Manual</em></span> for more information on how to use these relocation
            features with XTOS and in your system software.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If this is selected, carefully
                review the <em class="ph i">Alternate Static Vector Base Address</em>. Xplorer attempts to choose a
                good default, but when memories are changed a good default for this is not
                necessarily obvious</div>
