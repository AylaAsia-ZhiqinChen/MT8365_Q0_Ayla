README for Binutils Source Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recent versions of binutils can be built with support for Xtensa
processors.  If for some reason you prefer to use these tools instead
of the tools provided by Tensilica, you can obtain the standard
binutils source files and build them yourself.  Note that these tools
will not be exactly the same as the tools provided by Tensilica.

The configuration-specific source files here are intended for use
with binutils version 2.18.  After obtaining the binutils source
files, you need to copy the files from this directory into the
following locations in the binutils source tree:

      bfd/xtensa-modules.c
      include/xtensa-config.h

After copying the configuration-specific files into the binutils
source tree, follow the standard directions for building and
installing binutils.
