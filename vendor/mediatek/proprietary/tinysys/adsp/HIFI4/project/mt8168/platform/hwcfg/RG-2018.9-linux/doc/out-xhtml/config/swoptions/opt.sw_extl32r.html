        <p class="p">All <span class="ph">Cadence</span> processors from Xtensa LX and Xtensa6 through LX3
            and Xtensa 8 include hardware to support two different kinds of L32R instruction: normal
            (PC relative) and "based". This software selection chooses how the target software is
            built (and how the compiler generates code) - whether it makes use of the standard PC
            relative address mode, or whether it uses the extended L32R HW support for a larger
            address range.</p>

        <p class="p">A processor needs a mechanism for accessing literals; numbers with values known at
            compile or link time. Literals are used for constants directly written in C and for the
            address of global variables. For example, in order to implement the C statement
                <samp class="ph codeph">x=123456</samp>, when x is a global variable, the compiler must put the
            literal <samp class="ph codeph">123456</samp> into a register, put the address of the variable
                <samp class="ph codeph">x</samp> into another register, and then store the value in the first
            register into the address from the second register. For small literals, the literal can
            be encoded directly inside a <samp class="ph codeph">movi</samp> instruction that moves the value of a
            literal into a register. For larger literals, the compiler places the literal value in
            memory and uses the <samp class="ph codeph">l32r</samp> instruction to load the literal from memory
            into a register. Normally <samp class="ph codeph">l32r</samp> is a PC-relative instruction which can
            load a literal from any memory location within 256 Kilobytes of the instruction invoking
            the <samp class="ph codeph">l32r</samp>. The compiler, assembler and linker work together to ensure
            that literals are placed in range of their invoking <samp class="ph codeph">l32r</samp> instruction,
            and even combine multiple literals with the same value to save memory. If however, you
            are using a local IRAM that is 256 KBytes or larger, the only place to put a literal
            that is in range might be inside the IRAM itself. Prior to the RD release, loading
            memory from an IRAM was slow and therefore undesirable. Therefore, <span class="ph">Cadence</span> offered the extended <samp class="ph codeph">l32r</samp> option for
            users of large IRAMs. With this option, the <samp class="ph codeph">l32r</samp> instruction loads from
            an offset of a global base register. This global base register can point to any memory
            allowing literals to be placed anywhere. However, there are disadvantages to the use of
            extended L32R instruction. In particular, this option is not supported by third-party
            RTOSs. Furthermore, since the base register is global, all the literals used by the
            program must be contiguous and therefore a program is limited to a total of 256 KBytes
            of literals, or equivalently 64K literals. Additionally, <span class="ph">Cadence</span> does not support dynamically loading and unloading
            code on software configurations that uses the extended L32R. Starting with the RD
            release, the hardware is able to load literals quickly even when they are in IRAM.
            Therefore, the extended L32R option is only supported for older hardware.</p>
