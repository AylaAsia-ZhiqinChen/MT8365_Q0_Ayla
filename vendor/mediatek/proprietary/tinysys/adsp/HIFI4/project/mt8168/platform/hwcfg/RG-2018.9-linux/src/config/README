README for Xtensa Configuration Description (Xtensa HAL) Header Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration-specific header files here are intended for general
use by open source packages that require Xtensa processor configuration
information.

The macros defined by these headers are a significant subset of the
Xtensa compile-time HAL documented in the Xtensa System Software
Reference Manual.  These headers also define other, undocumented macros.
However, to help ensure portability to future versions of these header
files, the use of undocumented macros is to be avoided.
