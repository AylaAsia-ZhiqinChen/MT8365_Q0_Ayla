This example is meant to illustrate module development of components which use
the XTSC core library TLM interfaces.

Note: The self_describing_file.checker.pl file is a perl script that can help detect
bridge errors when run against the xtsc.log file generated by running the pif2sb_bridge
executable with the master.vec input file.  For example:

  Linux:
    ./pif2sb_bridge --master
    perl ../scripts/self_describing_file.checker.pl xtsc.log

  MS Windows:
    Release/pif2sb_bridge.exe --master
    perl ../scripts/self_describing_file.checker.pl xtsc.log



Please see the XTSC User's Guide chapter on module development for more information.
