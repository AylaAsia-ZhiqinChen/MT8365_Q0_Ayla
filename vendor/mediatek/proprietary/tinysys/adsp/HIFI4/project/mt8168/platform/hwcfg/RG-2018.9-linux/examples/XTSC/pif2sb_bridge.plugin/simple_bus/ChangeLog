	* Simple bus version 2 released.
	
	This version is a drastic simplification of the first version,
	focussing on the most elementary features and capabilities of a
	bus modeled at the Transaction-Level with SystemC 2.0.

	* Simple bus version 2.3 released.

	This version uses byte addressing throughout all models. 
        Also, before simulation starts this version is performing a 
        one-time check for overlapping address spaces of the slaves 
        attached to the bus.

	* Used as an example for XTSC from Tensilica

	Modify the SystemC simple_bus example to use log4xtensa (a
        port of Tad E. Smith's log4cplus SourceForge library) in 
        the simple_bus and simple_bus_arbiter classes and to
        throw an exception instead of calling exit.  Also, remove
        all source files not needed for the pif2sb_bridge example.
        Also, notify transfer_done before return from handle_request
        with SIMPLE_BUS_ERROR.
        Note: The complete unmodified simple_bus example is
        part of the OSCI SystemC 2.1 release available from 
        www.systemc.org.
