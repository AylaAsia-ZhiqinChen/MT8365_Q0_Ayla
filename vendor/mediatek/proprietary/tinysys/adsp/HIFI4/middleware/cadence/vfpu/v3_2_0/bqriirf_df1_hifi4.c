/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Biquad Real IIR
  Computes a IIR filter (cascaded IIR direct form I or II using 5 
  coefficients per biquad + gain term). Real input data are stored
  in vector x. The filter output result is stored in vector r. The filter 
  calculates N output samples using SOS and G matrices.
  NOTES:
  1. Biquad coefficients may be derived from standard SOS and G matrices 
  generated by MATLAB. However, typically biquad stages have big peaks 
  in their step response which may cause undesirable overflows at the 
  intermediate outputs. To avoid that the additional scale factors 
  coef_g[M] may be applied. These per-section scale factors may require 
  some tuning to find a compromise between quantization noise and possible 
  overflows. Output of the last section is directed to an additional 
  multiplier, with the gain factor being a power of two, either negative 
  or non-negative. It is specified through the gain parameter of filter
  initialization function.

  Precision: 
  32x16 32-bit data, 16-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate stage outputs
  32x32 32-bit data, 32-bit coefficients, 32-bit intermediate stage outputs 
  f     floating point (DF I, DF II and DF IIt)

  Input:
  N             length of input sample block
  M             number of biquad sections
  coef_sos[M*5] filter coefficients stored in blocks of 5 numbers: 
                b0 b1 b2 a1 a2. 
                For fixed-point funcions, fixed point format of filter 
                coefficients is Q1.14 for 32x16, or Q1.30 for 32x16 and 
                32x32 
  coef_g[M]     scale factor for each section, Q15 (for fixed-point 
                functions only). 
  gain          total gain shift amount applied to output signal of the
                last section, -48..15
  x[N]          input samples, Q31 or floating point 
  Output:
  r[N]          output data, Q31 or floating point 

  Restriction:
  x,r,coef_g,coef_sos  must not overlap
  x,r                  must be aligned on 8-byte boundary 
  N                    must be a multiple of 2
