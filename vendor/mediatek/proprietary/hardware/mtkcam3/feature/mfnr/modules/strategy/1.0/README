WHAT IT DOES?
=============

MFNR core module Strategy has responsibility to decide if it's necessary to
do Multi Frame Noise Reduction and other information, such as capture frame
number, blending frame number, using full size MC or not.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

You cannot partial build this module only, but to build libmfllcore indeed.

libmfllcore partial build path:

    feature/common/mfnr/Android.mk

Library dependency:
  AOSP:
  - libutils.so
  - libcutils.so
  - libstdc++.so

  MTK:
  - libcamalgo.so
  - libmtkcam_modulehelper.so
  - libmfllnvram.a


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Create an IMfllStrategy instance by invoking

    IMfllStrategy::createInstance();

and init it with a NVRAM provider

    IMfllStrategy::init(const sp<IMfllNvram> &nvramProvider)

and caller can query strategy by the condition with the current ISO and exposure,
e.g.:

    // IMfllStrategy::queryStrategy(
    //     const MfllStrategyConfig_t &cfg,
    //     MfllStrategyConfig_t *out);
    spStrategy->queryStrategy(config, &config);


- v1.0
  The first version


* This module will be compiled as a static libary and be used by libmfllcore,
  which means you can only use the interfaces defined in:

      feature/include/common/mfnr/IMfllStrategy.h

  by linking shared libary

      libmfllcore.so

*** All the source code of this program were written by MediaTek co. ***
