MFNR / AIS core middleware


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

An platform-independent MFNR core and platform-dependent modules that do MFNR.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

User can choose MFNR core version by configuring these in Android.mk:

    MFLL_CORE_VERSION_MAJOR
    MFLL_CORE_VERSION_MINOR

Notice that, makes sure the version you specified is available for your platform.
And each of MFNR core module has his own version, different platforms may need
to select the correct module version.

Some other software configurations are also available to be configured in
Android.mk.

Here are library dependency list:
MFNR core , which needs the following libs from AOSP:
- libutils.so
- libcutils.so
- libstdc++.so

and the following libs from MFNR modules:
- libmfllbss.a
- libmfllcaptuer.a
- libmfllexifinfo.a
- libmfllperfserv.a
- libmfllimagebuf.a
- libmfllmemc.a
- libmfllmfb.a
- libmfllnvram.a
- libmfllstrategy.a


Module bss, which needs the following libs from MTK:
[v1.0]
- libcamalgo.so


Module capturer, which needs the following libs from MTK:

(none)


Module exifinfo, which needs the following libs from MTK:
[v1.0]
- libcameracustom.so

[v1.0]
- libm4u.so
- libmedia.so
- libcam_utils.so


Module memc, which needs the following libs from MTK:

Module perfserv, which needs the following libs from MTK:
[mt6797]
- libperfservicenative.so


Module strategy, which needs the following libs from MTK:
- libcamalgo.so


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

All modules (e.g. Camera HAL or an unit test) should use
IMfllCore as the public interface to talk with MFNR core.

Caller can use all interfaces from

    feature/include/common/mfnr/*.h
