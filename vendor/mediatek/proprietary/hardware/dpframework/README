The library 'libdpframework.so' is a proprietary library.
This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

libdpframework.so is the user interface of MediaTek hardware accelerator for image resizing, rotation, and color space transform.
It gets requests from multi-media services and HW composer, and it sends control commands to cmdq kernel driver.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  libutils.so
2.  libion.so
3.  libcutils.so
4.  libsync.so
5.  libdl.so
6.  libbinder.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libion_mtk.so
2.  libm4u.so
3.  libgralloc_extra.so
4.  libpqservice.so
5.  libpq_prot.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

This library is used by mtkcam, libJpgDecPipe, and MediaTek hwcomposer, to do image processing and video enhancement.
Mostly applications will use this library via those modules, which are all under HAL.
