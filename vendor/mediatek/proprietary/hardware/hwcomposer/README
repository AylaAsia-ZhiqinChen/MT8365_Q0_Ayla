This directory contains HWComposer HAL interface, which defines the interface of
HWComposer and is used to build a hwcomposer shared library.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

HWComposer is the implementation that leverages HW IPs to
share the workload of GPU, which reduces the power consumption and
accelerates the rendering performance.

It defines the interface of HWComposer and is used to
build the hwcomposer shared library.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libui.so
2.  libutils.so
3.  libcutils.so
4.  libsync.so
5.  libion.so
6.  libhardware.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libm4u.so
2.  bwc.so
3.  libion_mtk.so
4.  libdpframework.so
5.  libgralloc_extra.so
6.  libgem.so
7.  libperfservicenative
8.  hwcomposer.$(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM).$(MTK_HWC_VERSION).a
For example: TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM = mt6795
             MTK_HWC_VERSION = 1.2 or 1.3 or 1.4

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Files in this directory is used to
generate a shared library 'hwcomposer.$(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM).so'.
For example: TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM = mt6795

The shared library 'hwcomposer.platform.so' is loaded and invoked by
SurfaceFlinger at runtime and behaves as a hardware compositor that
shrares the workload with SurfaceFlinger for layer comsopition.


All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
