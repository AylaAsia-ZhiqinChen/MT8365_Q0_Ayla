test-policy, test-switchfps-arr and test-switchfps-frr are the unit tests for FpsPolicyService.
They use to test FpsPolicyService's function.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============

test-policy provides the sample code to know how to use the API of FpsPolicyService.
test-switchfps-arr use to test the ARR function. ARR shall switch different fps successfully.
test-switchfps-frr use to test the FRR function. FRR shall switch different fps successfully.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libutils.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libui.so
4.  libgui.so
5.  libbinder.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libfpspolicy.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/proprietary/hardware/libgem/' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

just execute the test-policy, test-switchfps-arr or test-switchfps-frr

test-policy, test-switchfps-arr and test-switchfps-frr source code in this library were written
by MediaTek co..
