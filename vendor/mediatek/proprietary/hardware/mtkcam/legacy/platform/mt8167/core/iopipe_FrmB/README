Library of MTK camera ISP driver, including driver interface and driver flow contorl flow.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libcam.iopipe.so contains MediaTek developed camera driver related driver interface and driver flow control.
Without them, camera functionalties will not work.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  liblog.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libcutils.so
4.  libcam_hwutils.so
5.  libstlprot.so
6.  libcam_utils.so
7.  libJpgEncPipe.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libimageio_plat_drv.so
2.  libcam.halsensor.so
3.  libimageio.so
4.  libcam.metadata.so
5.  libcamdrv.so
6.  libdpframework.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxxx\hardware\mtkcam\core' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Provide api for camera HAL to control the camera features.
all api interface are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxxx\hardware\include\mtkcam\iopipe)

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
