Library of MTK ISP internal data path driver, including DMA control flow.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libimageio_plat_drv.so contains MediaTek ISP internal data path driver.
Without this, MTK ISP will not work¡¨

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  liblog.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libstlprot.so
3.  libutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libcamdrv_FrmB.so
2.  libm4u.so
3.  libdpframework.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxxx\hardware\mtkcam\core' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Provide api for ISP normal path driver to control ISP internal driver.
all api interface are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\legacy\platform\mtxxxx\hardware\include\mtkcam\imageio)

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
