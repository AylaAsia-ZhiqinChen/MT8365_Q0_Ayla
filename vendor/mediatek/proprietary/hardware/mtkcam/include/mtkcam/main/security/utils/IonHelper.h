     * mmap() is a helper of mmap() system call that creates a new mapping in
     * the virtual address sapce of the calling process from a file descriptor
     * created by ION.
     *
     * @param addr
     *      If addr is NULL, then the kernel chooses the address at which to
     *      create the mapping; this is the most portable method of creating
     *      a  new  mapping.  If addr is not NULL, then the kernel takes it
     *      as a hint about where to place the mapping.
     * @param length
     *      The length argument specifies the length of the mapping.
     * @param prot
     *      describes the desired memory protection of the mapping
     *      (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).
     *      It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or
     *      more of the following flags:
     *
     *      PROT_EXEC  Pages may be executed.
     *
     *      PROT_READ  Pages may be read.
     *
     *      PROT_WRITE Pages may be written.
     *
     *      PROT_NONE  Pages may not be accessed.
     * @param flags
     *      The flags argument determines whether updates to the mapping are
     *      visible to other processes mapping the same region, and whether
     *      updates are carried through to the underlying file.
     *      This behavior is determined by including exactly one of
     *      the following values in flags:
     *
     *      MAP_SHARED
     *          Share this mapping.
     *          Updates to the mapping are visible to other processes
     *          that map this file, and are carried through to the
     *          underlying file.  The file may not actually be updated
     *          until msync(2) or munmap() is called.
     *
     *      MAP_PRIVATE
     *          Create a private copy-on-write mapping.
     *          Updates to the mapping are not visible to other processes
     *          mapping the same file, and are not carried through to the
     *          underlying file.  It is unspecified whether changes made to
     *          the file after the mmap() call are visible in the mapped region.
     *
     *
     *      Please refers to http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html
     *      for the reset flags available.
     * @param shared_fd
     * @param offset
     *      The contents of a file mapping are initialized using \p length bytes
     *      starting at \p offset offset in the file (or other object) referred
     *      to by the file descriptor \p shared_fd.
     *      \p offset must be a multiple of the page size as returned by
     *      sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE).
