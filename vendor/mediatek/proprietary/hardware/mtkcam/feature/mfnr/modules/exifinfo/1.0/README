MFNR core module: ExifInfo v1.0


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

ExifInfo is an information in JPEG header, and it's for debug and algorithm
simulation usage. We knows that the register maps are different in the different
platform, thereforce there's a MFNR core module ExifInfo to take responsibility
to collect all debug information and provide to caller reference.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

You cannot partial build this module only, but to build libmfllcore indeed.

libmfllcore partial build path:

    feature/common/mfnr/Android.mk

Library dependency:
  AOSP:
  - libutils.so
  - libcutils.so
  - libstdc++.so

  MTK:
  - libcameracustom.so
  - libmfllnvram.a


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Create a IMfllExifInfo instance by invoking

    IMfllExifInfo::createInstance();

and caller can update exif info to IMfllExifInfo by invoking these methods:

    1. updateInfo(const MfllCoreDbgInfo_t &dbgInfo)
    2. updateInfo(IMfllNvram *pNvram)
    3. updateInfo(unsigned int key, uint32_t value)

where means:

    1. update information from IMfllCore provided
    2. update information of NVRAM
    3. update information by key from debug_exif/cam/dbg_cam_mf_param.h


After updated information, caller can invoke method

    getInfo(unsigned int key)

to retrieve the value of the key and print it or dispatch to somewhere caller
wants.

Notice that, IMfllExifInfo need debug info tag from dbg_cam_mf_param.h.

- v1.0
  Supports dbg_cam_mf_param.h version 3.2 only


* This module will be compiled as a static libary and be used by libmfllcore,
  which means you can only use the interfaces defined in:

      feature/include/common/mfnr/IMfllExifInfo.h

  by linking shared libary

      libmfllcore.so

All the source code of this program were written by MediaTek co..
