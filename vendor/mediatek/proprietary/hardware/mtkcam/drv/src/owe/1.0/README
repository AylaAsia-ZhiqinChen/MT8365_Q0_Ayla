Library of MTK OWE HW User Interface driver.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libmtkcam_owe.so provides a interface to access Mediatek OWE HW. The interface includes virtual and physical owe interface to access the OWE HW.
It will interact with user driver(owe_drv.cpp) and kernel driver(camera_owe.c) throught system call. It provides the bridage to access OWE HW when the user who is belong to user space want to access OWE HW.
Besides, you can wait for hw frame done signal using this interface.
Without this, MTK OWE HW will not work!!

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  liblog.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libmtkcam_stdutils 

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\drv\src\owe\1.0' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Provide api for user who is belong to user space to control MTK OWE HW.
all api interface are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\hardware\mtkcam\drv\src\owe\1.0)

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
