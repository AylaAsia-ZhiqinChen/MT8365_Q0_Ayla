The share library "libGLES_mali.so" is the core Mali 3D GPU driver implementation.
(OpenGL ES 1.x/OpenGL ES 2.0/OpenGL ES 3.0/OpenCL 1.0/OpenCL 1.2)

It is mainly responsible for 3D graphics(EGL/GLES1.x/GLES2.0/GLES3.0) rendering
and General Purpose computing on GPU.
This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.

WHAT IT DOES?
==================
libGLES_mali.so:
The core 3D driver implementation used to process EGL/GLES commands submmited from
framework or 3D games.

The 3D HW jobs will be prepared and submit to kernel driver for further handling.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  libutils
2.  libcutils
3.  libbinder
4.  libc
5.  libdl
6.  libui
7.  libhardware
8.  liblog
9.  libstlport
10. libsync

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libmtk_mali_user.a
2.  libgralloc_extra.so
3.  libgpu_aux.so
4.  libdpframework.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==================
Android framework EGL/GL wrapper will load the 3D user space driver through egl.cfg.
EGL/GLES related APIs will pass to the wrapper and go through this user space driver.
This module is responsible for preparing HW jobs to GPU.
