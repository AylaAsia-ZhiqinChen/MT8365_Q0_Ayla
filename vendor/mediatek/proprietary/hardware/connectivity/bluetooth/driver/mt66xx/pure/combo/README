This directory contains Bluetooth driver layer code for test mode (Engineer mode, factory mode, META mode and hardware test tool).

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
It provides Bluetooth driver interfaces for test mode usage.
And provides the Bluetooth relayer function in Engineer mode for certification.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1. libcutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1. liblog.so
2. libnvram.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Files in this directory is used to
1. Generate a library named 'libbluetooth_mtk_pure.so', which provides Bluetooth driver interfaces for test mode usage.
2. Generate a library named 'libbluetoothem_mtk.so', which provides the directly operating interfaces to Engineer mode.
3. Generate a library named 'libbluetooth_relayer.so', which provides the Bluetooth relayer function in Engineer mode.


All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
