Library of MTK JPEG Encode feature.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libJpgEncPipe.so controls the MTK JPEG Encode flow and dispatch the encode tasks and parameters
to either SW or HW encoder to do the JPEG Encode tasks. This library also contains
MTK SW encoder for handling SW JPEG Encode tasks.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  liblog.so
2.  libutils.so
3.  libcutils.so
4.  libion.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libion_mtk.so
2.  libm4u.so
3.  libjpeg-alpha_vendor.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Provide api for JPEG Encode feature called from users under HAL directly.
all api interfaces are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\platform\mt6752\hardware\jpeg\inc)

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
