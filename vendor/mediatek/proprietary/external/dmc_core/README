 WHAT IT DOES?
===============================
There are two major components in this make file
1. Diagnostic Monitoring Collector(DMC)
The daemon collects KPIs from
- Modem Monitor(MDM), a daemon forward modem KPI with EM/ICD format.
- AP Monitor (APM), collects KPI from submission layer in AP vendor and system partition.
and provide DMC interface to clients (DMC APP) to collect KPIs.

As the result, DMC includs two lazy HIDL server:
- libdmc_server: to service DMA APP, currently, we only support single client.
- libapmonitor_server: to service submission layer in AP side.

2. Packet Monitor (PKM)
A daemon hooks TCP/IP stack and forward OTA packets to DMC core.
