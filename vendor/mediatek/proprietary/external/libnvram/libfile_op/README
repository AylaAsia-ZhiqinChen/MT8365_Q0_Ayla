This directory contains NvRAM libfile_op interface, which defines the interface of
libfile_op and is used to build a libfile_op related shared library.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
It provide interface to backup NvRAM data to backup partition.
and restore NvRAM partition when fielsystem is empty.
Without NvRAM backup or restore feature, factory data maybe lost in some
case.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libc.so
2.  libcutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libnvram.so
2.  libcustom_nvram.so


All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Files in this directory is used to
generate a shared library 'libfile_op.so'.

The shared library 'libfile_op.so' is loaded and invoked by
meta tool for backup, invoked by NvRAM daemon tool for restore operation.
