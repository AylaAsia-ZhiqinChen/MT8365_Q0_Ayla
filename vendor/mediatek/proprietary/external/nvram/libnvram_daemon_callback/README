This directory contains NvRAM libnvram interface, which defines the interface of
libnvram and is used to build a libnvram shared library.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
It provide interface to access NvRAM data which need by modules like WIFI/BT etc.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libc.so
2.  libcutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libcustom_nvram.so
2.  libnvram.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Files in this directory is used to
generate a shared library 'libnvram_daemon_callback.so'.

The shared library 'libnvram_daemon_callback.so' is called by
nvram_daemon.so. If nvram user want to access nvram data, it must wait nvram_daemon ready.
