The shared library 'libcvsd_mtk.so' is a CVSD codec with PLC implementation.
This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

CVSD codec with PLC is the implementation that encode audio PCM data to CVSD 
bitstream or decode CVSD bitstream to audio PCM data with packet loss 
concealment (PLC) algorithm.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libnativehelper.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libmtk_drvb.so


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

The shared library 'libcvsd_mtk.so' is loaded and invoked by
audio codec.


All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
