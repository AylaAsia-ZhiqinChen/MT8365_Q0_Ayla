//mtm_test : for memory performance test£¬ refer dex2oat behavior on L to simulate memory useage

:usage
  /system/bin/mtm_test -t <thread_num> -r <ratio>

/*
explain:
  -t to adjust thread num
    -t <num> : <num> stand for thread number, it must less than the project cpu total number
  -r to adjust the ratio [0-10]
    -r <num> : with a bigger number following the '-r' option, the proporation of the memory
               freed after the whole chunk malloc is higher, which means more time is needed
               to free the memory.
  cmd /system/bin/mtm_test
    default stand for /system/bin/mtm_test ¨Ct <project_cpu_total_number> -r 5
