This directory contains mSBC (modified SBC) interface,
 which defines the interface of mSBC and is used to build a shared library.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

mSBC is modified SBC, which is used as BT wide-band codec.

For encoder, the input is PCM, and output is mSBC bitstream.
For decoder, the input is mSBC bitstream, and output is PCM.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1.  libnativehelper.so
2.  libcutils.so
3.  libutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libmtk_drvb.so

Source code:
1.  sbc_synth.c
2.  sbc_enc.c
3.  sbc_dec.c
4.  sbc_common.c
5.  sbc_anal.c
6.  msbc_wrapper.c

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

It is a shared library 'libmsbc_mtk.so'.

The shared library 'libmsbc_mtk.so' is loaded and invoked by
Audio HAL at runtime and behaves as a BT codec.


All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
