This module creates the MDMI (Modem Diagnostic Monitoring Interface) shared
library for MDMI commands.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internally.


WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libVzw_mdmi_commands.so invokes MDMI commands.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  libcutils.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libmdmi-core.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

The libmdmi-device.so library should only be used by the authorized test apk.
(vendor/mediatek/proprietary/framework/opt/mdm/libmdmi/libmdmi_commands).

The source code for this library is written by MediaTek.
