//          The advantage is shutter lag has been minimized.
//          The drawback is final image has higher motion blur (cause by handshack)possibility .
//     - When CUST_MFLL_ENABLE_BSS_FOR_MFLL==1 (recommended),
//          Use the image with the highest sharpness as base image.
//          The advantage is the motion blur (cause by handshack) has been minimized.
//          The drawback is a longer shutter lag (average ~+100ms)
