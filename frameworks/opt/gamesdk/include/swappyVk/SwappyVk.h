/**
 * Determine any Vulkan device extensions that must be enabled for a new
 * VkDevice.
 *
 * Swappy-for-Vulkan (SwappyVk) benefits from certain Vulkan device extensions
 * (e.g. VK_GOOGLE_display_timing).  Before the application calls
 * vkCreateDevice, SwappyVk needs to look at the list of available extensions
 * (returned by vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties) and potentially identify
 * one or more extensions that the application must add to:
 *
 * - VkDeviceCreateInfo::enabledExtensionCount
 * - VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames
 *
 * before the application calls vkCreateDevice.  For each VkPhysicalDevice that
 * the application will call vkCreateDevice for, the application must call this
 * function, and then must add the identified extension(s) to the list that are
 * enabled for the VkDevice.  Similar to many Vulkan functions, this function
 * can be called twice, once to identify the number of required extensions, and
 * again with application-allocated memory that the function can write into.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *  (IN)    physicalDevice          - The VkPhysicalDevice associated with the
 *                    available extensions.
 *  (IN)    availableExtensionCount - This is the returned value of
 *                    pPropertyCount from vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.
 *  (IN)    pAvailableExtensions    - This is the returned value of
 *                    pProperties from vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.
 *  (INOUT) pRequiredExtensionCount - If pRequiredExtensions is nullptr, the
 *                    function sets this to the number of extensions that are
 *                    required.  If pRequiredExtensions is non-nullptr, this
 *                    is the number of required extensions that the function
 *                    should write into pRequiredExtensions.
 *  (INOUT) pRequiredExtensions - If non-nullptr, this is application-allocated
 *                    memory into which the function will write the names of
 *                    required extensions.  It is a pointer to an array of
 *                    char* strings (i.e. the same as
 *                    VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames).

/**
 * Initialize SwappyVk for a given device and swapchain, and obtain the
 * approximate time duration between vertical-blanking periods.
 *
 * If your application presents to more than one swapchain at a time, you must
 * call this for each swapchain before calling swappyVkSetSwapInterval() for it.
 *
 * The duration between vertical-blanking periods (an interval) is expressed as
 * the approximate number of nanoseconds between vertical-blanking periods of
 * the swapchainâ€™s physical display.
 *
 * If the application converts this number to a fraction (e.g. 16,666,666 nsec
 * to 0.016666666) and divides one by that fraction, it will be the approximate
 * refresh rate of the display (e.g. 16,666,666 nanoseconds corresponds to a
 * 60Hz display, 11,111,111 nsec corresponds to a 90Hz display).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 *  (IN)  physicalDevice   - The VkPhysicalDevice associated with the swapchain
 *  (IN)  device    - The VkDevice associated with the swapchain
 *  (IN)  swapchain - The VkSwapchainKHR the application wants Swappy to swap
 *  (OUT) pRefreshDuration - The returned refresh cycle duration
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 *  bool            - true if the value returned by pRefreshDuration is valid,
 *                    otherwise false if an error.
