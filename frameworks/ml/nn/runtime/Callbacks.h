 * The Callback classes are used internally by the NeuralNetworks runtime to
 * synchronize between different threads. An asynchronous task is launched
 * paired with a callback object. When a client thread requires the output being
 * generated by the asynchronous task, the client thread can wait for the result
 * and be blocked until it has completed. Any wait may safely be called
 * concurrently, even on the same callback object. When the asynchronous task
 * has finished its workload, it must immediately call "notify*". If the
 * asynchronous task has failed to launch, the function that tried to launch the
 * asynchronous task must immediately call "notify*". This "notify*" call
 * awakens any client threads waiting on the callback object.
 *
 * These classes exist to enable synchronization across HIDL. When
 * synchronization is only required in the same process, consider using
 * std::future, std::mutex, std::condition_variable, or std::experimental::latch
 * instead.
