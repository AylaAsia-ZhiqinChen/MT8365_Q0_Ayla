# If AUDIOSERVER_MULTILIB in device.mk is non-empty then it is used to control
# the LOCAL_MULTILIB for all audioserver exclusive libraries.
# This is relevant for 64 bit architectures where either or both
# 32 and 64 bit libraries may be built.
#
# AUDIOSERVER_MULTILIB may be set as follows:
#   32      to build 32 bit audioserver libraries and 32 bit audioserver.
#   64      to build 64 bit audioserver libraries and 64 bit audioserver.
#   both    to build both 32 bit and 64 bit libraries,
#           and use primary target architecture (32 or 64) for audioserver.
#   first   to build libraries and audioserver for the primary target architecture only.
#   <empty> to build both 32 and 64 bit libraries and primary target audioserver.
