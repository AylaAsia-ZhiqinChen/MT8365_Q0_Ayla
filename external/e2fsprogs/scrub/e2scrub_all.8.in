.SH NAME
e2scrub_all - check all mounted ext[234] filesystems for errors.
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B
e2scrub_all [OPTION]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Searches the system for all LVM logical volumes containing an ext2, ext3, or
ext4 file system, and checks them for problems.
The checking is performed by invoking the
.B e2scrub
tool, which will look for corruptions.
Corrupt filesystems will be tagged as having errors so that fsck will be
invoked before the next mount.
If no errors are encountered,
.B fstrim
will be called on the filesystem if it is mounted.
See the
.B e2scrub
manual page for more information about how the checking is performed.
