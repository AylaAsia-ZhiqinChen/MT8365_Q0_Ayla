description: "Fruit is a dependency injection framework for C++, loosely inspired by the Guice framework for Java. It uses C++ metaprogramming together with some new C++11 features to detect most injection problems at compile-time. It allows to split the implementation code in \"components\" (aka modules) that can be assembled to form other components. From a component with no requirements it\'s then possible to create an injector, that provides an instance of the interfaces exposed by the component."
