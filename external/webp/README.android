Local modifications:
- Copy public headers from src/webp to include/webp, so path to headers
  may be appended into CFLAGS without risk for other private headers
  (e.g. bits.h) to leak into
- Removed build files necessary for building via autoconf/automake tools
  These files are not required to build via Android.bp
- cherry-pick ab2dc893 Rescaler: fix rounding error
- cherry-pick aa65f89a HistogramCombineStochastic: fix free of uninit value

The Android.bp file creates WebP decoder and encoder static libraries which
can be added to any application by adding libwebp-decode and libwebp-encode to
'static_libs'.
