  <pre>Create a new ManagedZone.

Args:
  project: string, Identifies the project addressed by this request. (required)
  body: object, The request body. (required)
    The object takes the form of:

{ # A zone is a subtree of the DNS namespace under one administrative responsibility. A ManagedZone is a resource that represents a DNS zone hosted by the Cloud DNS service.
    "kind": "dns#managedZone", # Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#managedZone".
    "description": "A String", # A mutable string of at most 1024 characters associated with this resource for the user's convenience. Has no effect on the managed zone's function.
    "nameServers": [ # Delegate your managed_zone to these virtual name servers; defined by the server (output only)
      "A String",
    ],
    "creationTime": "A String", # The time that this resource was created on the server. This is in RFC3339 text format. Output only.
    "nameServerSet": "A String", # Optionally specifies the NameServerSet for this ManagedZone. A NameServerSet is a set of DNS name servers that all host the same ManagedZones. Most users will leave this field unset.
    "dnsName": "A String", # The DNS name of this managed zone, for instance "example.com.".
    "id": "A String", # Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server (output only)
