/**
 * Gallium query object support.
 *
 * The HW has native support for occlusion queries, with the query result
 * being loaded and stored by the TLB unit. From a SW perspective, we have to
 * be careful to make sure that the jobs that need to be tracking queries are
 * bracketed by the start and end of counting, even across FBO transitions.
 *
 * For the transform feedback PRIMITIVES_GENERATED/WRITTEN queries, we have to
 * do the calculations in software at draw time.
